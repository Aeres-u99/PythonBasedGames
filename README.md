# PythonBasedGames-cli-
This contains two games created by me using few resources available and tonnes of internet stuffs :D
Game 1: [SCARLET's GUESS THE NUMBER]
In this game the virtual girl Scarlet guesses a number and you will have to guess the number she guessed
If you guessed correctly you win or you loose :D
Game 2: [Hangman with ASCII]
This is mostly based on Al sweigart's work
I have added few ascii arts and more features [view the getAbout() function from code]
the code is enitrely the same only additional things were performed by me :)
Game 3: ... haven't started lets see when my insomnia asks me to create something more hehe
